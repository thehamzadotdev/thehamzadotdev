👨‍💻 Yo, I'm **Hamza** — a self-taught **Full Stack Developer** crafting modern, scalable, and performance-driven web apps that actually *feel alive*.  

🧩 My core stack lives in the **Next.js / React** ecosystem — powered by **TypeScript**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, and backed by **Node.js + PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**.  
I’m obsessed with writing clean, reusable code and turning UI mockups into fully functional digital experiences.  

🚀 I’ve built everything from **AI SaaS dashboards**, **dental management systems**, **drag & drop website builders**, and **customer support automation tools**, to **print-on-demand eCommerce stores**.  

⚙️ My workflow → design in Figma → code in VS Code → deploy on Vercel / Render → automate with GitHub Actions.  
I push pixels & logic till they align.  

🔥 Currently exploring:  
- **AI integration** (Claude + OpenAI APIs)  
- **Next.js server actions + Edge runtime**  
- **Dockerized full-stack deployments**  
- **Realtime apps with Socket.io**  

🧠 Philosophy → “Code should look as good as it runs.”  
☕ Power source → Coffee, deep focus, and 4AM grind mode.  
💬 Always open to collabs, ideas, and building something that *actually solves problems*.
